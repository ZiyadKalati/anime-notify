To the otakus with MacBooks and some love for the terminal:

There are certain animes that I wish another season would come out for, but I don't bother keeping track and I completely forget about them. So I created a little program that will search the web and notify me by email if any anime that I'm watching out for has aired or will air this year.

The list of names is placed in the anime_list text file in the assets folder. The names should be simple to make the search more accurate and a newline should be entered after the final list item.

In the "sendNotification.py" script, you should enter your recipient address, and I would say create a quick gmail account to use as the sender email. The password for the sender account needs to be supplied as well in this script file.
Make sure to also disable 2-step verification for the sender account allow "less secure apps" which can be found in the security settings of the account.

There are a few dependencies:
Lynx
Python 3.6

Lynx is a text-based web browser that makes it easier to extract data from a web page. It can be downloaded with:
	apt-get install lynx
but on OS X we don't have apt-get so we have to use homebrew instead... which also needs to be installed.

Type this into the terminal:
	/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Then:
	homebrew install lynx

And then go download python if you don't have it already.

To run the script, just type in ./animeReminder.sh in the terminal and it will run.
You can also schedule it to run regularly with launchd or cron, whatever works for you.
